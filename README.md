# phaseFieldLBM

**phaseFieldLBM** is a **GPU-accelerated**, lattice Boltzmann simulator for multicomponent flows based on a **conservative Allen–Cahn** phase-field formulation. 
Implemented in CUDA, it supports **D3Q19/D3Q27** for hydrodynamics and **D3Q7** for phase field evolution, enabling accurate interface dynamics and surface tension modeling.
Available cases: **jet** and **droplet**.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA (Compute Capability ≥ 6.0, 4+ GB VRAM recommended)  
- **CUDA**: Toolkit ≥ 12.0  
- **Compiler**: C++20-capable (GCC ≥ 11) + `nvcc` (partial C++20 support)
- **ParaView**: for `.vtr` visualization  

---

## 🚀 Run

```bash
./pipeline.sh <flow_case> <velocity_set> <id>
```

* `flow_case`: `JET` | `DROPLET`
* `velocity_set`: `D3Q19` | `D3Q27`
* `id`: simulation ID (e.g., `000`)

Pipeline: compile → simulate → post-process

## ⚡ Benchmark

Performance is reported in **MLUPS** (Million Lattice Updates Per Second).  
All benchmarks are performed in **FP32 precision**.  

| GPU             | D3Q19 (MLUPS) | D3Q27 (MLUPS) |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| RTX 3050 (4GB)  | 440           | 377           |
| RTX 4090 (24GB) | –             | –             |
| A100 (40GB)     | –             | –             |

*Important considerations:*  
- **D3Q19** uses 2nd-order equilibrium/non-equilibrium expansion
- **D3Q27** uses 3rd-order equilibrium/non-equilibrium expansion
- The current implementation is **not yet fully optimized**, with several **non-coalesced memory access patterns** that are planned to be improved in future revisions
- These methodological differences contribute to the observed performance gap, beyond the natural cost of upgrading from **19** to **27** velocity directions
